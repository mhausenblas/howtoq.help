## Basics
Let's start with the basics. What is Amazon Q? It's a generative AI (GenAI)
assistant with specialized capabilities for software developers, business 
intelligence analysts, contact center employees, supply chain analysts, 
and really anyone building with AWS. It can help you to get insights on your
data and accelerate your tasks, be that developing software or analyzing data.
You can also benefit from Amazon Q's advanced capabilities to build agentic workflows.

There are two products available currently under the Q brand:

- Amazon Q **Developer**: Is the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for
building, operating, and transforming software, with advanced capabilities 
for managing data and AI/ML. You want to use it if your main tasks revolve around
coding, testing, deploying, troubleshooting, performing security fixes, 
modernizing applications (migrate or rewrite legacy apps), 
optimizing AWS resources, and creating data engineering pipelines.
- Amazon Q **Business**: Makes GenAI securely accessible to everyone in your
organization. Leveraging your own company's content, data, and systems, Amazon
Q Business makes it easier to get you fast, relevant answers to pressing questions,
solve problems, generate content, and take actions on your behalf.
